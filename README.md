# Yahtzee

Yahtzee is a game where you have to roll 5 dice and fill in a score sheet to get the highest score possible. All 5 dice can be held at any point to get the best score possible for that round, and dice can be rolled up to 3 times per round, playing a total of 13 rounds per game

## Testing

- I have tested the website on the following browsers: Google Chrome, Safari (mobile version), Microsoft Edge.
- I can confirm the website is fully responsive to all screen sizes on the browsers stated.
- When testing each of the game scores, I done manual testing by manually changing the dice numbers to match the code I was testing, to make sure it worked as intended

### Bugs 
#### Fixed Bugs

- Scores box
    - Scores boxes had unexpectedly changed size so the boxes were almost invisible
        - I noticed I had accidentally changed the height in the score class to 10leftpx when changing the board names 
        - The bug was fixed by removing the word "left".
    - Bonus scores box wasn't working properly with design responsiveness.
        - When I was testing screen sizes, the score for the bonus points would drop to the left board total score, moving the box for the total score to the left.
        - The bonus box previously had an explanation of how to get the bonus. This has been moved to the bottom of the gameboard, and is linked appropriately, which has fixed the bug.
    - Score for the sixes wasn't updating with the click
        - When Testing, I noticed that whenever I clicked on the sixes box, the score wouldn't update
        - I hadn't added the sixes score function to the new round function, so when the sixes box was selected, the sixes score function was never getting called. 
    - Four of a kind and full house weren't displaying truthfully if any dice was held beforehand
        - When testing, I noticed using the potential scores function, that 4 of a kind wasn't displaying when I had held numbers, same with full house.
        - This was because, after the dices array was sorted, whenever the computer found a dice with the held class, it'd skip over it entirely, so if this dice number was in a different place in the array, it wouldn't actually update.
        - I fixed this by checking the class name of the dice being held, and then setting the dice value in that position to the number on the held dice.
    - Full house wasn't displaying when 3 of a kind was smaller numbers than pair.
        - When testing, I found that my full house was resulting in 0 in the full house scores section.
        - I found that I hadn't skipped to the next iteration in the for loop when I had found 3 of a kind, which therefore meant the loop would double check the same condition for the current dice being the same as the next dice, which would in turn break the loop.
    - Yahtzee was scoring 100 instead of 50 when there was a yahtzee for the user
        - I found that when a user would get a yahtzee, they'd get 100 points when they selected yahtzee, instead of 50.
        - I found that I set the gotYahtzee boolean to true before checking if the user had got a yahtzee already.
        - I fixed this bug by checking if the score the user had selected was yahtzee when checking if the user had already got yahtzee, so that there wasn't a double scoring in the yahtzee score
    - Multi Yahtzee wasn't updating total score
        - When I was testing yahtzee, I got 2 yahtzees in one game, and noticed that my score for the left board was lower than the score I had recieved with that one yahtzee
        - I fixed this by checking the class of the parent node of the score I had clicked, and then updating the score with the extra 50 points 
    - Multi Yahtzee score was recieved even without yahtzee being recieved
        - If the player selects anything other than yahtzee when they get a yahtzee, the score gives an extra 50 points
        - I found that the boolean gotYahtzee updated to true when potentialScore was being called and the player got a yahtzee
        - I fixed this by moving the gotYahtzee boolean from the yahtzee function to the newRound function, and checked if the player got 50 points from the yahtzee function before calling gotYahtzee as true

#### Unfixed bugs

- None

### UX Testing

- These are the completed goals compared to the user stories I created at the beginning of the project

#### First Time Visitor

- Using the header of the page, I have made sure that anyone visiting the website for the first time will recognise that the website is a game
- I added a rules button in the top left hand corner of the website, so that any users can find out the rules of the game
- In the rules, I added 1 example of each of the scores so that players have an idea of what scores they can get
- In the rules section, I explained the different scores, and what scores users can get with each scores box

#### Returning Visitor

- In the rules, I have included a navigation bar, that users can cycle through each of rules, basic strategies and advanced strategies to make getting the highest score possible as simple as possible.
- For the returning visitors ease, I made sure to add a faded score, which represents the score the user can get with the current dice roll

#### Frequent Visitor

- I added a high score at the top left of the page so that someone can see their high score. In future, I would like to have the high score saved in a local file, so that the user can close the page, and then see their high score each time they open the website

#### Author Targets

- At the header of the page, I have put a h1 heading of Yahtzee! so that all users know the name of the game they're playing 
- At the top left of the page is a rules button, which displays the rules of the game for the user
- The rules section includes strategies, which can be cycled through via the navigation bar at the top.
- I added the potential score function to let the user understand what score they can get with their current roll
- When the user selects a score, the dice will reroll, the number of rolls left will be reset to 3 just before the reroll and will update whatever score they have selected to display the correct score for it

## Deployment

- The website was deployed via github, and the steps to do so are as follows:
    - Find the settings tab at the top of my github repository, and open
    - Along the left hand side of the settings page, find the pages tab under code and automation, and open
    - Click on the dropdown menu under source and select the main branch, then save
    - Once saved, the website will be published
