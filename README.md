### Bugs 
#### Fixed Bugs

- Scores box
    - Scores boxes had unexpectedly changed size so the boxes were almost invisible
        - I noticed I had accidentally changed the height in the score class to 10leftpx when changing the board names 
        - The bug was fixed by removing the word "left".
    - Bonus scores box wasn't working properly with design responsiveness.
        - When I was testing screen sizes, the score for the bonus points would drop to the left board total score, moving the box for the total score to the left.
        - The bonus box previously had an explanation of how to get the bonus. This has been moved to the bottom of the gameboard, and is linked appropriately, which has fixed the bug.

#### Unfixed bugs

- None
